Goals - VBA script for Stock Breakdown answers the question, how can we automate excel to create a stock breakdown using VBA. The VBA script creates and formats the following new columns: Ticker, Yearly Change with conditional formating, Percent Change and Total Stock Volume. In addition to these new columns, three data analysis fields for Greatest Increase, Decrease, and total volume for each tab from 2016-2014.
